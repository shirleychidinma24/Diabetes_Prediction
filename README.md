# Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction Web Application** built using a Machine Learning model trained on a healthcare dataset. Users can input key health parameters (e.g. Glucose, BMI, Age, Pregnancies), and the app predicts their likelihood of having diabetes.

The solution consists of:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration, model training & evaluation.
- A **Streamlit** app for a user-friendly interface to make predictions.
