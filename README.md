# Diabetes Prediction App

This project is a **Diabetes Prediction Web Application** built using a Machine Learning model trained on a healthcare dataset. Users can input key health parameters (e.g. Glucose, BMI, Age, Pregnancies), and the app predicts their likelihood of having diabetes.

The solution consists of:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for data exploration, model training & evaluation.
- [You can see ml_diabetes jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shirleychidinma24/Diabetes_Prediction/blob/main/Ml_Project.ipynb)
- A data exploration visualization
- ![Data exploration visualization Screenshot]()

- A **Streamlit** app for a user-friendly interface to make predictions.

## Key Features
- Loads a pre-trained Diabetes model and scaler.
- Scales user inputs and provides real-time diabetes risk predictions.
- Displays the predicted outcome with confidence level.
- Interactive interface powered by Streamlit.
